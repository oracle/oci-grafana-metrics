# Local Installation (Linux) - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana

## Background

Grafana is a popular technology that makes it easy to visualize metrics. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana is used to extend Grafana by adding OCI as a data source. The plugin enables you to visualize metrics related to a number of OCI resources: Compute, Networking, Storage, and custom metrics.

This walkthrough is intended for use by people who would like to deploy Grafana and the OCI Data Source for Grafana on a local server.

Make sure you have access to the [Monitoring Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm) and that [metrics have been enabled](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm) for the resources you are trying to monitor.

## Getting OCI Configuration values

To configure OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source, you'll need to get the necessary provider and resource settings. Please note that Migrating from version 3.x.x to 4.x.x will require to migrate the existing data source configuration: using version 4.x.x of the plugin with the data source configuration of version 3.x.x is **not possible**. In case you are migrating from previous version 3.x.x of the OCI Metrics Grafana Plugin, you can refer to the [**Migration Instructions for Grafana OCI Metrics Data Source Settings (User Principals and Single Tenancy mode only)**](migration.md). If you are configuring the plugin to work in Multitenancy Mode, you will need to repeat the following steps for each of the Tenancies you want to configure with the plugin (up to 5 additional Tenancies are supported).

### Getting the Region

To get the region for your OCI cloud, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the OCI console.
2. From the OCI menu, select the **Region** dropdown in the top right corner of the page.
3. The region is listed next to **Home**.

For details and reference, see: [Regions and Availability Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#top)
Make note of the region as you'll need it later to configure your OCI Metrics Grafana Data Source.

### Getting the Tenancy OCID

## Install Grafana and the OCI Metrics Plugin for Grafana

To [install OCI Metrics Plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/oci-metrics-datasource/) make sure you are running [Grafana 8**](https://grafana.com/get). Use the [grafana-cli tool](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/installation/) to install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana from the command line:

```
grafana-cli plugins install oci-metrics-datasource
```

**NOTE** Today the latest version of the plugin 4.x.x is available only with Grafana CLI. We will release its binary on [its Github repo](https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-plugin) very soon.

The plugin will be installed into your Grafana plugins directory, which by default is located at /var/lib/grafana/plugins. [Here is more information on the CLI tool](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/installation/).

### Manual installation for previous Grafana Server versions(<8)

Alternatively, you can manually download the .tar file and unpack it into your /grafana/plugins directory. To do so, change to the Grafana plugins directory: `cd /usr/local/var/lib/grafana/plugins`. Download the OCI Grafana Plugin: wget `https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-plugin/releases/download/<v.version#>/plugin.tar`. Create a directory and install the plugin: `mkdir oci && tar -C oci -xvf plugin.tar` and then remove the tarball: `rm plugin.tar`.

> **Additional step for Grafana 7**. Make sure the plugin version is <= 2.2.4. Open the grafana configuration  *grafana.ini* file and add the `allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = "oci-datasource"` in the *plugins* section.

*Example*

```
    [plugins]
    ;enable_alpha = false
    ;app_tls_skip_verify_insecure = false
    allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = "oci-datasource"
```

To start the Grafana server, run: `sudo systemctl start grafana-server`.

Navigate to the Grafana homepage at http://localhost:3000.

For **Environment** choose **local** and then choose between **single** or **multitenancy** as **Tenancy mode**.
You can then choose between two different modes as **Tenancy mode**:

* **single**: to use a single specific Tenancy
* **multitenancy**: to use multiple tenancies

### Configure Plugin in Single Tenancy Mode
If you selected **single** as **Tenancy mode** then fill in the following credentials:

* `Profile Name` - A user-defined name for this profile. In **single** mode this is automatically set to **DEFAULT** and cannot be modified.
* `Region` - An OCI region. To get the value, see [**Getting Region Configuration value**](#getting-the-region).
* `User OCID` - OCID of the user calling the API. To get the value, see [**Getting User OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-user-OCID).* 
* `Tenancy OCID` - OCID of your tenancy. To get the value, see [**Getting Tenancy OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-tenancy-OCID).
* `Fingerprint` - Fingerprint for the key pair being used. To get the value, see [**Getting Fingerprint Configuration value**](#getting-the-api-key-fingerprint).
* `Private Key` - The contents of the private key file. To get the value, see [**Getting Private Key Configuration value**](#getting-the-private-key).

The configured data source will look like the following:

![Datasource Filled](images/datasource_conf_filled.png)

Click **Save & Test** to return to the home dashboard.


### Configure Plugin in Multi-Tenancy Mode
If you selected **multi** as **Tenancy mode** then fill in the following credentials for **each Tenancy you want to configure (up to 5 additional tenancies)**:

* `Profile Name` - A user-defined name for this profile. The first Tenancy is automatically set to **DEFAULT** and cannot be modified. You need to specify a custom and unique Profile name for each of the additional tenancies.
* `Region` - An OCI region. To get the value, see [**Getting Region Configuration value**](#getting-the-region).
* `User OCID` - OCID of the user calling the API. To get the value, see [**Getting User OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-user-OCID).
* `Tenancy OCID` - OCID of your tenancy. To get the value, see [**Getting Tenancy OCID Configuration value**](#getting-the-tenancy-OCID).
* `Fingerprint` - Fingerprint for the key pair being used. To get the value, see [**Getting Fingerprint Configuration value**](#getting-the-api-key-fingerprint).
* `Private Key` - The contents of the private key file. To get the value, see [**Getting Private Key Configuration value**](#getting-the-private-key).

By default, if you selected **multi** as **Tenancy mode** you can configure one DEFAULT tenancy with an additional one. You may add others tenancy **(up to 5 additional tenancies)** using the **Add another Tenancy** checkbox.

The configured data source will look like the following:
