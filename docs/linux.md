# Local Installation (Linux) - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana 

## Background

Grafana is a popular technology that makes it easy to visualize metrics. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana is used to extend Grafana by adding OCI as a data source. The plugin enables you to visualize metrics related to a number of OCI resources: Compute, Networking, Storage, and custom metrics. 

This walkthrough is intended for use by people who would like to deploy Grafana and the OCI Data Source for Grafana on a local server. 

Make sure you have access to the [Monitoring Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm) and that [metrics have been enabled](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm) for the resources you are trying to monitor.  

## Install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI 

The [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm) provides you with a way to perform tasks in OCI from your command line rather than the OCI Console. It does so by making REST calls to the [OCI APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm). We will be using the CLI to authenticate between our local environment hosting Grafana and OCI in order to pull in metrics. The CLI is built on Python (version 2.7.5 or 3.5 or later), running on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

Begin by [installing the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm). Follow the installation prompts to install the CLI on your local environment. After the installation is complete, use the `oci setup config` command to have the CLI walk you through the first-time setup process. If you haven't already uploaded your public API signing key through the console, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#How2) to do so. 

After the CLI has been configured, move the `~/.oci` folder to `/usr/share/grafana` and then change ownership of the `/usr/share/grafana/.oci folder` to the “grafana” user: `sudo chown -R grafana:grafana /usr/share/grafana/.oci`. Update the `key_file` location in `/usr/share/grafana/.oci/config` to the current folder `/usr/share/grafana/.oci/your_key.pem`.
## Configure OCI Identity Policies

In the OCI console under **Identity > Groups** click **Create Group** and create a new group called **grafana**. Add the user configured in the OCI CLI to the newly-created group.

Under the **Policy** tab click **Create Policy** and create a policy allowing the group to read tenancy metrics. Add the following policy statements:

- `allow group grafana to read metrics in tenancy`
- `allow group grafana to read compartments in tenancy`

## Install Grafana and the OCI Metrics Plugin for Grafana 

To [install OCI Metrics Plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/oci-metrics-datasource/) make sure you are running [Grafana 8**](https://grafana.com/get). Use the [grafana-cli tool](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/installation/) to install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Source for Grafana from the command line:

```
grafana-cli plugins install oci-metrics-datasource
```

**NOTE** Today the latest version of the plugin 3.x.x is available only with Grafana CLI. We will release it's binary on [its Github repo](https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-plugin) very soon.

The plugin will be installed into your Grafana plugins directory, which by default is located at /var/lib/grafana/plugins. [Here is more information on the CLI tool](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/installation/).

### Manual installation for previous Grafana Server versions(<8) 
Alternatively, you can manually download the .tar file and unpack it into your /grafana/plugins directory. To do so, change to the Grafana plugins directory: `cd /usr/local/var/lib/grafana/plugins`. Download the OCI Grafana Plugin: wget `https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-plugin/releases/download/<v.version#>/plugin.tar`. Create a directory and install the plugin: `mkdir oci && tar -C oci -xvf plugin.tar` and then remove the tarball: `rm plugin.tar`. 

>  **Additional step for Grafana 7**. Make sure plugin version is <= 2.2.4 . Open the grafana configuration  *grafana.ini* file and add the `allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = "oci-datasource"` in the *plugins* section.

*Example* 
```
    [plugins]
    ;enable_alpha = false
    ;app_tls_skip_verify_insecure = false
    allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = "oci-datasource"
```

To start the Grafana server, run: `sudo systemctl start grafana-server`. 

Navigate to the Grafana homepage at http://localhost:3000.
