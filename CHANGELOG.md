# [Added a region option to getCompartment method (V1.0.9)](https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-metrics/releases/tag/V1.0.9) - 12 Mar 2020

When OCI tenancy is provision with a single region, say 'us-phoenix-1' (home tenancy) and the datasource setting with local has the default regions as 'us-ausburn-1' (in the ~/.oci/config file), the getCompartment does not return the compartment list. The reason being the OCI tenancy has only one tenancy as home and that is not the 'us-phoenix-1' tenancy.

The fix is to set region to the home regions of the OCI tenancy, while making the getCompartment call.

Thanks Jayesh Patel

# [Manual query support. New template variables for dimensions. (V1.0.5)](https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-metrics/releases/tag/V1.0.5) - 25 Nov 2019

1. New template variables were added: 
 - `dimensions()` which show all possible dimension keys for selected region, compartment, namespace and metric
- `dimensionOptions()` which show all possible dimension values for selected region, compartment, namespace, metric and dimension key.

2. Dimension value variable can be used as multi-value. Separate queries are generated for each dimension value out of multi-select (but no more than 20 queries)

3. Custom query is supported. User can type MQL expression manually which will be passed to telemetry instead of selected on the UI metric and dimensions.

4. Custom template variables were added to the list of dimension value options. Duplicate options are removed.

5. Options for regions and compartments are cached while query editor is open. Dimension options are cached for the selected region - compartment - namespace - metric.

[Changes][V1.0.5]

# [Fix $namespace and $metric variables (V1.0.4)](https://github.com/oracle/oci-grafana-metrics/releases/tag/V1.0.4) - 03 Oct 2019

`$namespace`
In the previous version, the list of namespaces was hardcoded for the $namespace variable. 
Today the list of namespaces depends on region and compartment.

`$metric`
In the previous version, the $metric variable depends on the home region, $compartment and hardcoded $namespace. 
Today $metric depends on $region,  $compartment and $namespace.
